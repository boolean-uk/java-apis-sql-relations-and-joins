1. Refactor the database tables so that the Actors,
Directors and Writers all identify people (using a Foreign Key)
that are present in a single People table

CREATE TABLE films (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  director_id INT,
  star_id INT,
  writer_id INT,
  year INT,
  genre TEXT,
  score INT,
  UNIQUE(title),
  CONSTRAINT fk_director
  	FOREIGN KEY(director_id)
  		REFERENCES peoples(id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_star
  	FOREIGN KEY(star_id)
  		REFERENCES peoples(id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_writer
  	FOREIGN KEY(writer_id)
  		REFERENCES peoples(id)
  );

  CREATE TABLE peoples(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    dob TEXT
    );

2. Where necessary refactor the queries to take advantage of this
new structure

1. Show the title and director name for all films
SELECT title, peoples.name
FROM films
INNER JOIN peoples ON director_id = peoples.id

2. Show the title, director and star name for all films
SELECT title, peoples1.name as directors, peoples2.name as stars
FROM films
INNER JOIN peoples as peoples1 ON director_id = peoples1.id
INNER JOIN peoples as peoples2 ON star_id = peoples2.id

3. Show the title of films where the director is from the USA
SELECT title
FROM films
INNER JOIN peoples ON director_id = peoples.id
WHERE peoples.country = 'USA'

4. Show only those films where the writer and the director are the same person
SELECT *
FROM films
INNER JOIN peoples as peoples1 ON director_id = peoples1.id
INNER JOIN peoples as peoples2 ON writer_id = peoples2.id
WHERE peoples1.name = peoples2.name


5. Show directors and film titles for films with a score of 8 or higher
SELECT title, peoples.name
FROM films
INNER JOIN peoples ON director_id = peoples.id
WHERE score >= 8

6. Make at least 5 more queries to demonstrate your understanding of joins, and other relationships between tables
    i. Show film score and writer email:
    SELECT score, peoples.email
        FROM films
        INNER JOIN peoples ON writer_id = peoples.id

    ii. Show stars name, stars birthday and film year:
    SELECT peoples.name, peoples.dob, year
        FROM films
        INNER JOIN peoples ON star_id = peoples.id

    iii. Show title, and director, star and writer
    SELECT title, directors.name, stars.name, writers.name
        FROM films
        INNER JOIN peoples as directors ON director_id = directors.id
        INNER JOIN peoples as stars ON star_id = stars.id
        INNER JOIN peoples as writers ON writer_id = writers.id

    iv. Show count of different directors countries
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country)
    FROM peoples

    v. Show original table
    SELECT title, directors.name as Director, directors.country as director_country, stars.name as star, stars.dob as star_dob, writers.name as writer, writers.email as writer_email, year, genre, score
    FROM films
    INNER JOIN peoples as directors ON director_id = directors.id
    INNER JOIN peoples as stars ON star_id = stars.id
    INNER JOIN peoples as writers ON writer_id = writers.id
